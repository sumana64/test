1.java nd javac

when we write the java program we are going to save the file with as .java in notepad.
later to compile the program we javac command with the filename(javac filename.java) to compile the file.
after the compilation we run the program using java command with the filename(java filename)to execute the program.
ex-class Name{                

    String name;

   public static void main(String[] args){

    Name nm = new Name();
    nm.name = "xworkz";
    System.out.pritnln(nm.name);

  }
   

}

to compile this we use javac Name.java
to run we use java Name


2.JVM-declared as java virtual machine.it is not physically present,but virtually exist.
It loads the bytecode.
It verifies the bytecode.
It execute the bytecode.
It provides the runtime environment to execute the bytecode.
It is somewhere present in the jre.

JRE-declared as java runtime environment
it is phusically exist.it contains jvm nd set of libraries.
jre execute the byte using the set of libraries but in background jvm provide runtime nd execute the bytecode.
if we get .class file we run the file using jre.to run the file we use jre.

Jdk - declared as java development kit
it is physically present, it consist of jvm development tools.
it is called as fully featured software development tool
it is used to write nd execute the file.
it is used to debug the code..compile the code nd it consist of java libraries.

3.Array is container used to store the multiple copies of data.it is used to store the sequence of data.
array is non premative wheather it is declared with premitive.
In array if size is fixed we cannot store the data more than the size.
we cannot store different type of data..if it is declared with the one datatype.
in order to access the array we need to use the for loop.
data is stored in sequencial order starts with index 0.

4.class is blueprint or template or design consist of state nd behaviour.
it is declared once nd it is single copy nd logically exist.
class Soap{    - class
  
String name;
String color;
String shape;

public void manufactureSoap(){

System.out.println("soap is manufactured in factory");

}

}

object - it is instance of class use dto create multiple copies of the class.

ClassName referenceof class = new ClassName();

new keyword is used to create object nd to allocate the object in the memory.

Soap sp = new Soap();

5. java file consist of source code.when we write the program it is saved as the .java which is of byte code.
 compiler is used to convert sourcode to byte code sent to jvm to execute the bytecode.
bytecode is platform independent.
.java file is converted into .class file sourcode to bytecode in which jvm can underastand only the bytecode.
if we get .class file we can execute the file directly.

6.class Factory{

  String material;
  
  public void manufactureProduct(String material){

      System.out.prinln("products are manufactured in factory");

  }
}

method signature = methodname with parameter inside the parenthesis
 
methodName(parameter)- manufacureProduct(String material);

7.java is object oriented programming language used to develop the software.
it is founded by jamesgosling nd team.it is used as platform to develop the appliactions.

8.notepad++,eclipse,intellij,visual studio

9.variable is container use to store the data it can be used in the later stages..registered srea allocated in the memory.
local variable-it is declared inside the class inside the method.declaration nd intialization is mandatory.
nodefault values for lacal variable.its scope is within the method
static variable-declared inside the class outside the method with static keyword.declaration is mandatory intialization is not mandatory.
if we dont intialize it is intialized as defaul values by complier
instance - it is declared insdide the class out side the method without static keyword.
declaration is mandqatory..instialization is not mandatory.it accessed by the reference of the object.
paremeter-paramneter are passed at the time of method declaration inside the parenthesis.its scope is within the method

10.class,extend,new,System,public,private,protected,final,super,this..

11.class variable are the static variable which are declared outside the method..inside the class with static keyword.declaration is madatory..intialization is not madatory.
we can access them using only the classname.

12.datatype is used to represent the type data we are storing into the variable.
there are two types of datatype - premitive nd nonpremitive
premitive-byte,short,int,long,double,float,char,boolean
nonpremitive- classtype, String ,referncetype, system

13.it used to access the method - inbuild nd userdefined nd variables

14.java is simple nd secure.
java is object oriented.
java has no limitations.java is platform independent.
java is multithreaded.it is open soure

15.object is the base class of all the classes

16.method overloading - more than one method declared with the same name with the different parameter list

class App{

 static String name;

 static double contactNo;

 static String emaiId;

public static void login(String name){

  System.out.println("the name of person is:" + name);

}

public static void login(double contactNo,String emailId){

   System.out.println("contactno of person is:"  + contactNo);

   System.out.pritnln("emailid of person is :" + emailid);

   

}
